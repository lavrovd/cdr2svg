librevenge 0.0.5

- Fix a bunch of issues discovered by oss-fuzz.
- Require C++11 for building.
- Modernize the code a bit.
- Fix assignment of RVNGString from a C String. The previous code would
  append to the current content instead of replacing it.
- When appending a characer to an RVNGString (i.e., using the char overload of
  append()), don't validate the character. Some libraries use this
  function to construct an RVNGString from UTF-8 code points.
- Drop outdated MSVC project files.
- Extend API documentation a bit.
- Emit viewBox attribute for SVG output to fix user unit to ensure
  proper scaling.
- More fixes for GDB pretty printers.

librevenge 0.0.4

- Fix possible crash in raw generators for unbalanced open/close calls.
- Fix build in C++11 mode.
- Fix gdb pretty printers and make them compatible with Python 3.
- Fix RVNGString::Iter::last(), which only worked correctly for strings
  containing only ASCII characters.
- Document the difference between RVNGString::len() and RVNGString::size().
- Considerably improve performance of RVNGString iterator (a crude
  measurement shows at least 45% improvement).

librevenge 0.0.3

- SVG generator: fix the center of rotation.
- Remove bashism in configure (libwpd#5).
- Fix some syntax errors in documentation.
- Text generator: handle footnotes and endnotes.
- Improve performance of RVNGPropertyListVector::append() and
  RVNGBinaryData::append().
- Fix several crashes or hangs when reading broken OLE2 or Zip files, found
  with the help of american-fuzzy-lop.
- Fix build with boost 1.59 (libwpd#6).
- Handle table:number-columns-repeated and table:number-rows-repeated in
  all spreadsheet generators.
- CSV generator: handle rows with uneven number of columns correctly.
- CSV generator: ignore empty rows at the end.
- Several minor improvements and fixes.

librevenge 0.0.2

- Better handling of invalid input in RVNGDirectoryStream functions.
- Add documentation for RVNGDirectoryStream.
- Add text:outline-level to allowed paragraph properties. This is to allow
  import libraries to handle headings properly.
- Properly handle units in all generators, instead of expecting everything is
  in inches.
- Implement open/closeGroup for RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator.
- Improve handling of layers in RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator.
- Handle master pages in RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator and
  RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator.
- Simple handling of tables in RVNGSVGDrawingGenerator and
  RVNGSVGPresentationGenerator: just create a text box for each cell.
- Fix return value of RVNGStringStream::seek when seeking to end.
- Fix some warnings found by Coverity.
- Use symbol visibility on Linux. The library only exports public functions
  now.
- Fix several crashes or hangs when reading broken OLE2 or Zip files, found
  with the help of american-fuzzy-lop.
- Add fo:language, fo:country and fo:script to allowed span properties.
- Handle headings in RVNGHTMLTextGenerator.

librevenge 0.0.1

- Fix license headers in some files.
- Export API symbols on windows.
- Really allow to disable build without streams and generators.
- Detect CppUnit in configure already.
- Drop dependency of librevenge-stream to Boost.Filesystem.
- Do not throw exception when constructing RVNGDirectoryStream for an unexistent
  directory. Instead, create a valid dummy stream that will respond negatively
  to all operations (for consistency with RVNGFileStream).
- Fix return type of RVNGBinaryData::getDataStream(). This change does affect
  neither API nor ABI.
- Add some documentation for RVNGBinaryData.
- Create a Coverity model covering the majority of librevenge data types, for
  the benefit of projects that use librevenge.
- Several minor improvements and fixes.
